# Usage with React

To use tRPC with React, you can use the official `@trpc/react-query` package. It's a thin wrapper around [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) that provides type safety as well as the same proxy based API as the vanilla client.

## 1. Installation

Install the `@trpc/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query` packages.

```bash
npm install @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query
```

## 2. Create the React bindings for your tRPC client

Create a file called `utils/trpc.ts` and add the following code:

```js {22} title="utils/trpc.ts"
import { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react-query';
import { type AppRouter } from '~/server/router';

export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();
```

## 3. Wrap your app in `trpc` and `QueryClient` context providers

Finally, we'll wrap the rest of our application, `<YourApp />{:js}`, in the `trpc` and `QueryClient` context providers.

```js title="main.tsx" /<YourApp />/#b
import * as React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';

import { trpc } from './utils/trpc';

function App() {
  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());
  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>
    trpc.createClient({
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({
          url: 'http://localhost:2022', // your server URL
        }),
      ],
    }),
  );
  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <YourApp />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
}
```

That's it! [Try it out for yourself!](/features/forms)
